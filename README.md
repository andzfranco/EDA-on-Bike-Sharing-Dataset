# EDA-on-Bike-Sharing-Dataset

This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning modeling on the Bike Sharing Dataset in Washington D.C. collected from 2011 to 2012. It utilizes both daily and hourly data to extract insights into bike usage trends across different features: times, season, weather conditions, and more.

I compared several machine learning models to predict bike usage, where I identified Random Forest performing best. Model predictions were interpreted using SHAP (Explainable AI) to identify key contributing features.
