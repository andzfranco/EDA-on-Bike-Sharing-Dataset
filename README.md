# EDA-on-Bike-Sharing-Dataset

This project is an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning modeling on the Bike Sharing Dataset in Washington D.C. collected from 2011 to 2012. It uses both daily and hourly data to extract insights into bike usage trends across different features: times, season, weather conditions, and more.
